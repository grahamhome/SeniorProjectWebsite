					We are following the SCRUM methodology for this project. This means that we will create and maintain the following artifacts:
					<br><br>
					<ul class="postList">
						<li>User story document</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Created at the beginning of the project and updated throughout the project as the user stories are elaborated upon by the project sponsor at the beginning of every sprint.</li></ul>
						<li>Trello board for Product and Sprint backlogs</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Updated at the beginning of every sprint as the team distills requirements from the user stories and adds them to the product and sprint backlog during sprint planning.</li></ul>
						<li>Slack channel for daily standup meetings</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Attended by every team member, every day.</li></ul>
						<li>Burn-down chart</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Continually updated by the team members during each sprint so a clear snapshot of the team’s progress towards the sprint goals will always be available.</li></ul>
						<li>Sprint post-mortems</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Documented at the end of every sprint and shared with the coach and project sponsor.</li>
						<li>Planning poker to assign story points to user stories: occurs at the beginning of every sprint as part of sprint planning and is documented for future reference.</li></ul>
						<li>Time tracking</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Using <a href="www.toggl.com">Toggle</a>, the individual team members will track their time each time they engage in an individual or group activity related to the project and will present the time tracking statistics to the coach and sponsor at the end of each sprint.</li></ul>

					As this project will be run using the Scrum methodology, the team will deliver a new unit of functionality at the end of every sprint. The sprint goals will be determined at the beginning of every sprint, and the team’s ability to meet that goal will be assessed at the end of each sprint so a realistic goal can be set for the next one. The sprint goals and the result of each sprint will be presented to the coach and sponsor so they can assess the team’s progress on a regular basis.

					The team will track the project using the following metrics:
					<ul class="postList">
						<li>Time Worked</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Toggl will be used to track hours of work for the team through a web interface. Toggl was chosen because of its ease of use, no cost, and because part of the team had past experience with Toggl. The team will review its hours worked at the end of every Sprint.</li></ul>
						<li>Velocity</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li>Velocity for each developer will be tracked through a spreadsheet on Google Drive. This will show the team how much a developer can handle, and if a developer is under/overworked. We will also compare the planned velocity to the actual velocity to see if we are meeting our expectations or if they are too high or too low.</li></ul>
						<li>Project Backlog</li>
						<ul class="postList"><li> The team will monitor the amount of story points completed on the project with every sprint. This will allow the team to track the progress of the overall project, and see if the team is ahead or behind of schedule.</li></ul>
