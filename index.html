				<p class="postText">
					Cigarette smoking rates in the US have dropped significantly over the past few decades with help from massive pushes from the private and public sector to educate the public on the dangers of smoking. However, 17% of the US population still smokes cigarettes, remaining unresponsive to current efforts. The Smoking Cessation application will be meant to reach this population in a way that has not been available previously. The application will use empirically supported Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques to identify habits and triggers of individual smokers and provide ‘just in time’ treatment to assist overcoming cravings.
				</p><br>
				<p class="postText">
					The project’s purpose will be a data-driven application that tracks users’ smoking habits and uses this information to provide effective CBT that is tailored to the user’s unique triggers and habits at times with a high risk for relapse. The project will collect initial information about the feelings and habits of the user, and then it shall collect data on instances of smoking as they occur. This data collection phase shall drive the presentation of effective intervention techniques to the user. The project will also allow therapists and researchers to analyze the user’s smoking data in real time.
				</p><br>
				<p class="postText">
					The Smoking Cessation application will first be released to the public on the Android platform. Collected data will be made available to researchers and therapists via a Web application. The long-term goals will include deployment to all other mobile platforms.
